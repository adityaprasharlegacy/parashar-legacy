    <h2>The Journey Begins</h2>
    <p>
      I am Aditya Pratap Dubey, born on July 17, 2005, in Bilaspur, Chhattisgarh. At 19, I reflect on a life that has already seen doubt, confusion, and transformation. My early school years lacked direction, but a spark changed everything: astrology.

    <h2>Path of the Stars</h2>
    <p>
      After endless calls and research, I was drawn to Rajasthan, where I now study BA in Astrology under the guidance of Dr. Bhavyadeep Bhartiya—recognized in the India Book of Records. This path feels like destiny.

    <h2>The Parashar Legacy</h2>
    <p>
      My lineage traces back to Rishi Parashar, the father of astrology, through Vashishta and Shakti. Knowing this gave meaning to my intuitive talents. I’ve always had a gift—sensing energies, reading people, offering advice that brings peace.
